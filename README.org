#+title: weather

This is a package for generating plots and eventually a dashboard for
weather data taken from [[https://forecast.weather.gov][forecast.weather.gov]]. This is somewhat related
to [[https://github.com/ntBre/weatherbar][my weatherbar project]], but it uses a different, and apparently
fuller, source of data that includes a 7-day forecast of things like
temperature, precipitation chance, humidity, and cloud cover.

Right now I'm just extracting the data from the XML and plotting it
with [[http://www.gnuplot.info/][gnuplot]]. A current example of the output is shown below.
